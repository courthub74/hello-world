# hello-world

Nothing excites me more than learning.  I love to code. 
Coding is creativity.  Coding is syntax.  Coding is algebra. 
I love all three of those things.  I'm good at them to say the least.
The fact that I can create applications to spread information and/or
value across the web makes my day.  I work very well alone, but I'm 
great collaborator too.
